# DISCLAIMER: I'm not a lawyer/CPA and this is not a binding legal advice.

Assumptions:
  Annual revenue for the year in concern is maximum 3 million PHP.
  There will be no other income sources [where such income are not subject to final tax. ], like a concurrent employer-employee relationship / part time work.

1) On the first business day of the year/before starting business/profession/consultancy:
  A. Go to your LGU's Treasury Office to request for an Occupational Tax Receipt(OTR).
  B. Register as self-employed/professional with the BIR. Usually Form 1901 is used if you don't have an existing TIN.
   Bring contract if there is, "ledger book" to be stamped there, PHP500 registration fee.
   As for printing of receipts, you can ask around the BIR office as they handle these for some margin, else you
   also need to fill out something relating to "Authority to Print Receipts" (ATP)-related documents.
2) Upon completion of your registration you should have:
   (1) BIR Form 2303 : Certificate of Registration
   (2) Official Receipts (OR) booklets
   (3) Stamped book of ledger.
   (4) "Ask for Receipt" notice.

OPERATIONS
  Anually thereafter, you need to pay an annual registration fee (ARF) on or before 30JAN.
  Every time you are paid, you need to issue an OR to payor and record transactions in the ledger.
